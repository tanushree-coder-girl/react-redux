1) Instructions 
    what is Redux => 
    Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing and centralizing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces. 

2) Why We need Redux ? 
    Redux allows you to manage your apps state in a single place and keep changes in your app more predictable and traceable. It makes it easier to reason about changes occuring in your app. 

3) Redux Architecture 
    Action 
        It collects data from component or from API 
    Reducer 
        Get data from action and sent to store 
    Store 
        state of complete application 
    View 
        React component 

4) Installation with React Redux 
    npm install redux 
    npm install react-redux 

5) Makes Necessary files and wrappers 
    Folders =

    1) components 
    2) services 
        1) Actions 
                index.js
        2) Reducers 
                index.js   (root reducer)
                reducer.js
        3) constants.js 
        4) store.js 

6) what is action 
    Actions are the only source of information for the store as per Redux official documentation. It carries a payload of information from your application to store. As discussed earlier, actions are plain JavaScript object that must have a type attribute to indicate the type of action performed.

    way of writing action 

    export const actionToPerform = (data) => {
        return {
            type : 'PERFORM_ACTION',
            payload : data
        }
    }

    use of constants => 
        For larger projects, there are some benefits to defining action types as constants: It helps keep the naming consistent because all action types are gathered in a single place. Sometimes you want to see all existing actions before working on a new feature.

    also can decalre variables in constants.js file like this
        export const PERFORM_ACTION = "PERFORM_ACTION";

    and import like this 
        import { PERFORM_ACTION} from './../constants'

    declare action then like this 
        export const actionToPerform = (data) => {
            return {
                type : PERFORM_ACTION,
                payload : data
            }
        }

7) What is Reducer
    In Redux, a reducer is a pure function that takes an action and the previous state of the application and returns the new state. The action describes what happened and it is the reducer's job to return the new state based on that action.

    way of writing reducer function 

    const initialValue = 1;

    const myreducer = (state = initialValue, action) => {
        switch (action.type){
            case 'PERFORM_ACTION' : 
                return state + action.data;
            default :
                return state;
        }
    }

    export default myreducer;

8) What is Root Reducer 
    A Redux app really only has one reducer function: the "root reducer" function that you will pass to createStore later on. ... A reducer may be called with undefined as the state value when the application is being initialized.

    way of writing root reducer 

    import myreducer from './reducer';
    import { combineReducers } from "redux";

    const rootReducer = combineReducers({
        myreducer,
    });

    export default rootReducer;

9) What is Store 
    A store is an immutable object tree in Redux. A store is a state container which holds the application's state. Redux can have only a single store in your application. Whenever a store is created in Redux, you need to specify the reducer. Let us see how we can create a store using the createStore method from Redux.

    way of writing store 

    import { createStore } from "redux";
    import rootReducer from './Reducers/index';
    const store = createStore(rootReducer);
    export default store;

10) import store and provider in index.js file 

    import store from "./services/Store";
    import { Provider } from "react-redux";

    ReactDOM.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <Provider store={store}>
        <App />
        </Provider>
    </React.StrictMode>,
    document.getElementById("root")
    );

11) what is useDispatch     
    useDispatch is a function that we import from react-redux library and assign it to a variable. And with this, we are able to dispatch any action to the store by simply adding an action as an argument to the new variable like the code above and that's it.

    use in your component like this 

    import { useDispatch } from "react-redux";
    const dispatch = useDispatch();
    <button onClick={()=>dispatch(actionToPerform(data))}> Division </button>

12) what is useSelector 
    Let's start by importing useSelector from the react-redux library. useSelector is a function that takes the current state as an argument and returns whatever data you want from it. ... Similar to useSelector , useDispatch is a function that we import from react-redux library and assign it to a variable.
    
    import { useSelector } from "react-redux";
    
    const value = useSelector((state)=> state.myreducer);

    <h1> {value} </h1>
